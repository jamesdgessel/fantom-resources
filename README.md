## About

Welcome to **Fantom Resources**, the magical land where all your dreams of learning **Fantom** and **SkySpark** come true—assuming your dreams involve sifting through other people's work. This is not the holy grail; it’s just a repository. But hey, it’s better than aimlessly wandering the internet, right?

By now you've realized that ChatGPT sucks at Fantom, and even more so at Axon. Welcome to the club.

## 📂 What's in This Glorious Collection?

Two things, and don’t expect more:
1. **Links to resources someone else made**: I’ve "curated" a list of resources (read: Googled for you) that helped me learn.
2. **Pre-built development environments**: The only thing I hate more than baked fruit (pie is the worst dessert, don't @ me) is configuring development environments. Fret not, for I have suffered for you. Clone it, run it, pretend you're grateful and lets move on from this repulsive topic.

If you're trying to learn basic SkySpark, you're in the wrong spot. Stop now, don't try, this will bore you and you'll end up hating SkySpark.

## 🤔 Why Should You Care?

Honestly, you probably don’t. But... you did find your way here somehow. So, this might help you...
- Learn Fantom or SkySpark without pulling your hair out.
- Avoid painful setup and just start coding.
- Find some code you can copy/paste, since you've definitely already tried chatgpt and stack-overflow.

# Resources
### hello
## 🎁 The Ultimate (and Probably Incomplete) Resource List

If it exists, I *might* have linked it. If I didn't, then it wasn't marketed well enough. 

### Fantom Tools & Libraries
- **[Fant](https://github.com/fantom-lang/fant)**: The official package manager for Fantom. A real lifesaver if you enjoy typing `fant install` repeatedly.  
  *Developer: Fantom Foundation.*

### SkySpark Tools & Extensions
- **[SkySpark Core Docs](https://www.skyfoundry.com/doc)**: Official docs. Read them if you like manuals or need a cure for insomnia.  
  *Developer: SkyFoundry.*
- **[Phable](https://github.com/skyfoundry/phable)**: A Haystack API client library, because JSON parsing is the new cardio.  
  *Developer: SkyFoundry.*
- **[Haxall](https://haxall.io/)**: SkySpark, but open-source and slightly riskier. Like swimming with sharks.  
  *Developer: SkyFoundry.*

### Tutorials & Learning Resources
- **[Fantom Lang Website](https://fantom.org)**: The official Fantom site. Come for the language, stay for the bland design.  
  *Developer: Fantom Foundation.*
- **[Axon Quick Start](https://www.skyfoundry.com/learn/axon)**: Your crash course in Axon. Spoiler: it’s SkySpark’s scripting language.  
  *Developer: SkyFoundry.*

### Open-Source Fantom Examples
- **[Fantom Starter Projects](https://github.com/fantom-lang/fantom-starter)**: Sample projects so you can pretend to know what you’re doing.  
  *Developer: Fantom Foundation.*

## 🚀 Getting Started (I'm lazy, you're lazy, lets accept it and just move on)

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fantom-resources.git
   cd fantom-resources
   ```

2. **Initialize Submodules**:
   If you've got a stick up yo.... if you don't want to deal with submodules you don't have to. But you'll regret it since there's some good stuff in there.
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. **Find Your Way Around**:
   - `environments/`: Pre-built setups. Minimal effort required.
   - `resources.md`: Links to stuff we didn’t want to host directly.

## 🎓 About Fantom and SkySpark

**Fantom**: A programming language that’s niche enough to make you feel special.  
**Axon**: I can't decide if its more or less niche... but its easier to learn and more useful if you're just using SkySpark. 
**SkySpark**: An analytics tool for buildings, because HVAC data isn’t going to optimize itself.
