# About

If you're here, you know that ChatGPT sucks at Fantom, and even more so at Axon. Welcome to the club. No doubt you also know that there are limited/scattered resources for learning Fantom & Axon. 

This repo is my attempt at documenting my learning journey in hopes it can help someone else. Fair warning: I come from engineering, not CS. If you have a CS background you probably think my approach to learning is ridiculous, so fair warning. 

Here you will find 
1. A curated (read: stumbled upon) list of resources that helped me out
2. An attempt to collect these resources into an easily-usable & mess-around-able format
